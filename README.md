# SQL Healthcare & Business Analytics (Simulated)

## Overview
This repository contains a structured SQL analytics project built on a **simulated General Hospital database**.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate analytical thinking, SQL proficiency, and governance-ready interpretation across healthcare and business contexts.

All data used is **non-production, simulated, and anonymised**, created purely for portfolio demonstration.

## Analytical Themes Covered

### 1. Operational Performance
Analysis of hospital activity, patient flow, and capacity indicators, including:
- Admissions trends
- Busiest departments
- Length of Stay (LOS)
- ICU utilisation
- Peak admission periods

### 2. Risk Indicators
Identification of operational and clinical risk signals such as:
- Readmissions (hospital and department level)
- Inpatient readmission hotspots
- LOS and readmission overlap
- High-acuity (ICU + readmission) risk areas

### 3. Quality & Compliance
Evaluation of quality performance using standardised measures:
- Compliance rates by hospital and practice
- Identification of lowest-performing quality measures
- Governance-focused prioritisation of improvement areas

### 4. Cost & Value (Surgical)
Assessment of financial efficiency and value delivery:
- Average surgical LOS and cost by specialty
- Profitability by surgical specialty
- Resource-level cost drivers

### 5. Data Quality & Governance
Validation of data reliability prior to analysis:
- Date format and parsing checks
- Logical consistency (admission vs discharge)
- Referential integrity (orphan records)
- Numeric conversion readiness

## Relevance to ERP / SAP Analytics (Including SAP HANA)
The analytical structure and governance-focused approach used in this project mirrors how data is analysed and reported in enterprise environments such as **SAP HANA**, where operational performance, risk, quality, and cost insights are integrated to support decision-making and audit readiness.
