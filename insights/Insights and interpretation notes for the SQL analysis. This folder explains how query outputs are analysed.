# Findings Summary (Interpretation Guide)

This document summarises how outputs from the SQL analysis should be interpreted.
To avoid exposing dataset-specific results, the focus is on analytical reasoning,
governance insight, and decision-support thinking rather than numeric values.

All analysis is based on simulated, non-production healthcare data.

## 1. Operational Performance — Key Insights

**Admissions Trends**
Admission analysis highlights periods of higher operational demand.
Hospitals experiencing sustained or seasonal peaks may require proactive
capacity planning and workforce alignment.

**Busiest Departments**
Departments with consistently high encounter volumes represent operational
pressure points. These areas benefit most from workflow optimisation,
staffing review, and process efficiency initiatives.

**Length of Stay (LOS)**
Higher average LOS may indicate discharge delays, complex case mix, or
process inefficiencies. When elevated LOS aligns with high admission
volumes, the risk of capacity bottlenecks increases.

**ICU Utilisation**
Higher ICU utilisation reflects increased patient acuity and operational
strain. This metric should be reviewed alongside LOS and readmissions
to understand compounded risk exposure.

**Peak Admission Days**
Identifying peak admission days supports scheduling and staffing decisions
to maintain service quality during high-demand periods.

## 2. Risk Indicators — Key Insights

**Readmissions**
Readmission rates serve as a proxy for care quality and discharge
effectiveness. Elevated rates may indicate gaps in care coordination
or post-discharge follow-up.

**Inpatient Readmission Hotspots**
Departments with higher inpatient readmission rates require closer
review, as these often signal deeper operational or clinical issues.

**LOS and Readmission Hotspots**
Departments exhibiting both longer LOS and higher readmission rates
represent compounded risk areas. These hotspots should be prioritised
for targeted improvement initiatives.

**Diagnosis and Procedure Risk Patterns**
Grouping readmissions by diagnosis or procedure helps identify clinical
categories associated with higher risk, enabling focused quality
improvement efforts.

**High-Acuity Risk (ICU + Readmission)**
Encounters involving both ICU care and readmission highlight high-acuity
risk populations that warrant enhanced governance oversight.

## 3. Quality & Compliance — Key Insights

**Compliance by Hospital and Measure**
Compliance analysis enables benchmarking across hospitals and highlights
measures requiring attention or corrective action.

**Practice-Level Compliance**
Practice-level views help identify operational sources of non-compliance,
supporting targeted interventions rather than broad system-wide changes.

**Lowest-Performing Measures**
Focusing on the lowest-performing measures allows leadership to prioritise
improvement efforts and allocate resources effectively.

## 4. Cost & Value — Key Insights (Surgical)

**Cost and LOS by Specialty**
Surgical specialties with higher cost and longer LOS may indicate
opportunities for efficiency improvement or cost optimisation.

**Profitability by Specialty**
Profitability analysis supports service-line decision-making and helps
identify areas that may require operational redesign or financial review.

**Resource-Level Cost Drivers**
Resource-level analysis highlights what drives surgical costs, enabling
targeted cost management without compromising care quality.

## 5. Data Quality & Governance — Key Insights

**Date Validity**
Invalid or inconsistent date formats undermine LOS and trend analysis.
Ensuring reliable date parsing is essential for trustworthy reporting.

**Logical Consistency**
Discharge dates occurring before admission dates indicate data integrity
issues that must be addressed prior to analysis.

**Referential Integrity**
Orphan records across encounters, quality measures, or departments can
distort reporting and should be resolved through governance controls.

**Numeric Conversion Readiness**
Validating numeric fields stored as text (e.g. LOS) ensures analytical
calculations are accurate and reliable.

## Closing Note

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytical workflow:
defining business questions, building structured SQL logic,
validating data quality, and translating outputs into
governance-ready insights suitable for operational reporting
and decision-making.
